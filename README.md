# GitLab MR Approval Viewer

## What does this extension solve?

After switching over to GitLab, I noticed that when relying on an approval system for Merge Requests, it was hard to know upfront which ones you've already approved. This extension was made to make it clear to know which Merge Requests you've gone through without having to click into each and every one.

## Usage
1. Download the `gitlab-approval-chrome-ext.crx` from the repo.
2. Open your extensions page in Chrome.
3. Drag and drop the file into the window and install.
4. You're done!

Otherwise, go to the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitlab-approvals/pkkmcaoiinhniniafikpmhajlddofikj)!

## Current Limitations

### Settings

There are a few settings available -- check out the options panel for the extension for more info!

The extension now works on ALL domains (that I've tested). If you have any issues with any particular domain, leave an issue for me to review!
